                <p>eyup, thx for clicking ! u have arrived at my monthly artdump: sachersketchbook. like many other neocities netizens, i had a disconnect with social media & no longer wanted to post my stuffs- yet i still wanted a place to myself where i could chronologically archive all of my digital art. and so, this website was made- a hopefully more hands-on and engaging approach to explore my hobbies & tangential thoughts w/o relying on 3rd party sites. every month/two months updates with a new batch of artwork i've made in that time. cool.</p>

                    <summary>a self-reflection on this era of my artwork [& the fear of regression]</summary>
                    <p>i used to feel a lot of shame over these artworks, so much so that i almost decided not to share them here.
                        not because they're bad, but because of the complete opposite- the fact that i believe these
                        arts are way more technically sound and visually appealling than what i make in 2023-24.</p>
                    <p>i think that the fear of 'getting worse' is one that's prevalent among artists, and i especially
                        had internalized this a lot in early 2023, when i started diverging from my usual art program. 
                        during this time i was noticing stagnation in my 'improvement,' and i felt such panic over it,, but now looking back, 
                        i think that's dramatic to say. (1)well duh i'm rusty, i'm using a newer program. (2)it's 
                        like. really fun to experiment. staying in the same style/techniques/program forever sounds kinda 
                        boring anyhow.</p>
                    <p>hiding this era's drawings seems like a shame cuz they're genuinely really good. but
                        letting them define my art now also seems like a shame too. so. we have the equilibrium.
                        acceptance~~</p>
                    <p>i feel a lot less shame looking at my 21-22 works today. my newer stuff's different, sure, but calling
                        one era of work 'better' than another is just a bit unfair imo. simplier or more mundane doesn't
                        equate to being worse, and for what i make now, my art fits.</p>
                    <p>mostly, i just want to draw my hot characters in peace.</p>
