                        <p>you ever read a nsfw fanfiction so beautiful that it inspires you to write again?</p>
                        <p>not write smut, i'm talking like regular sfw. anyways, that's happening with me rn. hi, i'm getting back into writing prose again. thank you fandom authors of ao3, i owe this creative-writing rejuvination to you. i don't even know what re-animator is.</p>
                        <p>on a more serious note, i've been stuck in a bit of a writing slump for around a year now and have recently and very suddenly leapt out of it. 
                            the journal entry from 5-24-24's just REEEEKS of that old frustration. 
                            dunno how long this motivation will last but for the first time  
                            in a very long time i'm having fun with writing again. amazing what the palpable love-of-the-game of another creator can do to a mf.
                        </p>
                        <p>i feel like how i was at 15 years old doing her first nanowrimo: <i>that</i> is the speed at which 
                            i am pouring my guts out into this google doc. unfortunately, some things never change and i will never post 100% of what i am working on... 
                            just know that i'm on that GRIND. the grind for a prequel oneshot for marcene, isra, and callisto, abt how they all met and died and revived and allthat. i'll likely 
                            put out some related artwork instead when i'm finished. yippe!</p>

                            <summary>on a related tangent: is it just me or have AI editors gotten worse? </summary>
                            <p>i used to LIVE ON wordtune when i was in highschool and it was genuinley a lifesaver. 
                                now i feel as if it's downgraded in quality so much - i'm not talking about the limited rewrites here - i'm 
                                saying in general: the sentences that they suggest flow way less naturally than what i remember and the app is much more prone to glitches and rejecting sentences that are perfectly normal. maybe it's because the novelty has worn off, 
                                maybe it's always been like this, maybe the frequency of new AI editors screwed them over...? either way, it 
                                kind of saddens me. like a trustworthy mentor turning senile. i still use wordtune occasionally to get synonyms and inspo 
                                for sentence rewording, but alas. 
                            </p>
                            <p>grammarly is fine i guess, judging from a very brief skim. i tried using it to check my punctuation and still got frustrated and closed the tab LOL.</p>
                            <p>editors like these are helpful to a certain extent, but can't bounce off stylistic choices very well. 
                                really unhelpful for checking sentence flow and cohesion...... unless you're paying money for extra features, which uuuuuu...... 
                            </p>
                            <p>i also love prowritingaid but 70% of all the good shit is behind a paywall. it's a reasonable one in comparison to the last two but i. yeah.</p>
                            <p>anyways that's it from me, happy fall yayyyyy!</p>

                            creative writing and being percieved</h3>
                        <p>yknow, publicizing any form of writing, fiction or not, requires a certain amount of trust
                            with or
                            at least some kind of awareness of the audience right. once you make a writing public,
                            it's no longer YOURS - it's the people's. you can intend a certain messege however you want,
                            but what the <i>audience</i> interprets of that message is how YOUR writing will be
                            percieved - not what YOU interpret of it. and that's a hurtle that i have not been able to
                            get over for a majority of my creative journey.</p>

                        <p>...which is kinda paradoxical to say, because i love <i>visual</i> artwork and i love
                            sharing it, so i should be able to share my writing too right? but there is just something 
                            different in my mind between the medium of visual art, and the medium of prose, and that difference is strong enough to
                            me that i'm completely turned off by the idea of sharing any of my creative writing to the public. i can't explain it,
                            but i don't think i could ever showcase my stories/universes
                            in a way that feels <i>true</i>.
                            it used to tear me up inside, not being able to get tf over myself (lol) and just post
                            <i>something.</i> but nowadays i've
                            found contentment with fact that the deeper aspects of my work are only available to
                            like the TINIEST select friend group. cuz why do i even NEED to share ALL of my words, you
                            know??!?!? even if something's not that serious, if it's important to me, why should 
                            i ever post it?</p>

                            artwork eventually.</p>
                        <p>i took a peek at some WIP versions of this i had stowed away, and honestly. i think the
                            final piece is over-rendered.
                            in my illusts, i feel like there's more charm when i leave some parts messy,
                            and tbh i think some messiness would help to add more distinction between the two
                            figures here too. bc i do feel like they blend in too much here.</p>

                        <h3><span class="highlight-2">&thinsp;2-15-24&thinsp;</span> | dead times</h3>
                        <p>decided to revist an old OC playlist i hadn't listened to in a hot minute and 'spare
                            hearts' from catghost ost switched on and i nearly jumped out of my seat</p>
                        <p>i suddenly remembered how much this story used to influence my own OCs and how i can't
                            stand it now because of something unrelated that just happened to take place around that time. i can say
                            that for so many other medias too, it's unreal how jarrinly that song made me remeber 
                            just how pieces of media that i haven't watched or thought of in years that still show
                            their faces in the things i make to this day. how PTC's power/weapon system still has
                            vague correlations to a glitchtale AU [ew] i made when i was 14, how 'law of talos' was
                            the direct inspiration for callisto and marcene but i can't even stand to watch either
                            of them anymore, among others because of they're associated with,, euughhh points of my life.</p>
                        <p>reminded bitterly that many of my stories are created on the backs of inspos that were
                            accumulated over multiple years from all corners of my life and no matter what, i will
                            never not be able see myself through my works, no matter how mundane they are or how
                            much i do not want to be reminded of certain aspects from dead times.</p>
                        <p>it feels very silly to say all of this about pieces of writing that i'll probably never
                        publicize at all, but regardless of that, death of the author feels reaaally far away from
                        me.</p> -->

                        <p>i think that this site is nearing a 'complete' state, like with my more recent artworks,
                            i feel less of an urge to post/archive them here on neocities. with how selective i feel
                            about art-posting going into 2024, i feel like i've grown beyond this site, and i'm no
                            longer compelled to use it in the way that i've been using it like in 2023. after i
                            finish uploading jan-feb(?)'s batch of artwork, this site will probably go through a
                            revamp- i don't have any specific plans, i just think i need to do something
                            *different.* all artwork will stay up, of course, tho the exterior and main 'purpose'
                            will probs change a tad.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>I DONT KNOW!! i dont know how i feel abt this one tbh. my main intent going into this was
                            to tidy up file paths, but to more importantly, clean up the mobile version of the site.
                            something that REALLLY bugged me abt the old layout was the fact that, since all of the
                            main content was inside of a scrollable div instead of all being contained in the 
                            &lsaquo;main&rsaquo; tag, the search bar in mobile browsers wouldn't HIDE when you 
                            scrolled down the page. and considering x & y overflow were hidden too, this caused a 
                            lotta visual disparity for the main content block depending on the phone screen's size. 
                            this new layout was my attempt to fix that.
                        </p>
                        <p>i'll have to figure out how it looks on other devices to be 100% sure, but im v sure this
                            issue has been solved now. a part of me really misses the smaller, more compact look 
                            though. it's not all that different actually, but the old one was specifically more... 
                            rounder imo. i'll probably tweak the layout some more later down the line to get that 
                            vibe back, but we'll see.

                        <p>i was rereading some older OC profiles, and i realized that...
                            the more i like a character of mine, the more pathetically i describe them
                            &#128557; ...and it's not in the endearing "aww poor thing &#60;/3" kinda
                            pathetic, i mean, descriptions that are so deprecating they legitimatly give you
                            second-hand emberassment.
                        </p>
                        <p>i think i do this out of a subconscious fear of not giving my faves enough flaws. like.
                            fear
                            of them being percieved as a mary sue or "creator's pet" .....but in my desire to hold
                            back
                            my favoritism, i just end up writing them so unfavorably instead.</p>
                        <p>hmm, its so tough when u have a fave. no matter how hard u try, u can't portray them how
                            u
                            do in ur head. its either pretentious writing or severe nerfing in my experience. when i
                            read older writings of mine, the aspects i deemed as my least favorites ended up being
                            the most well-written in the end, because i didn't take them too seriously.
                        </p>
                        <p>its so hard not to take a character seriously tho when u already care so much.
                            how tf do ppl do it.... how to disconnect, my whole heart is in this bitch !!!
