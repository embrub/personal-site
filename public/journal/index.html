                    <p>i've started getting into house/garage dj sets lately. it became rly nice music to put in the background when i was studying for finals, nice variety but still not so overwhelming that u can't focus. they r usually very chill but not as drab as a lotta the lofi beats i used to try to listen to. <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/pixel__/pixel-tech-house-uk-garage-set-19-july-2024/" target="_blank">this set</a> by pixels has been my favorite lately. i would embed it but the widget is botched as hell.</p>

                    <p>sometimes as a creative u kinda jus realize that the reason a project nvr came thru isnt bc of perfectionism or scope creep or anything u said but just cuz the idea just wasn't that great and ur just meant to contend w that. i am talking abt myself if it was not clear</p>

                    <p>i want to practice what i preach, and what i constantly preach is the archival of one's old artwork no matter how cringe or awful because it meant something to you once and is a marker of how far you've come. but oh BOY oh BOYYY is it hard to live by those words. a completely harmless story from 2022 has been haunting me since i've posted it and i RESIST the EVIL URGE to delete it off both the internet and my hard drive at all times. i used to lament about why some artists release their work and then never interact with it again or even resist engagement in its discussion like they never wanna see it again. OK WELL I GET IT NOW. HAVE MERCYYYY.</p>
                    <p>no one even knows what i am talking about, this is just someshit i carry on my heart and soul and i don't purge it out of PRIDE. it is AWFUL to me and me alone but those who know deserve to look at it still and deserve to have it too. (i say, crumpled in the fetal position)</p>

                        <summary>danganronpa: despair time (the other half of trial 2) - webseries</summary>
                        <p>at the start, i felt very "meh" about it, and that feeling persisted all thru the trial UNTIL the final 2 episodes. then it all clicked and i felt like all of that buildup was WORTH IT. I GET IT NOWW. that was the best ending to a trial i've ever seen for a fangan - the only other one that is even comparable to this feeling of utter horror i felt is the ending to SDRA2 ch.5...... i know there was a lot of divisive discussion about who would've been the better blackened for trial 2 among the final 2 contenders, but the way this trial concluded has me convinced this is how it had to be. i loved this outcome and felt the execution was both fitting and surprisingly respectful. like. way to address a character's core flaw and challenge it so intensely. i still don't understand or like <span class="spoiler">david</span> though. shocker. i felt a little confused when he suddenly became a fan-favorite after his mask slipped this chapter. he still has a lot to answer for, and the fact that a lot of viewers started hearing him out cuz <span class="spoiler">he pulled this "i suddenly care about xander now" thing is.... i don't know. i'm aware he knows what teruko's REAL secret is and that's partly why he started to defend xander: cuz he <i>knows</i> something now..</span> but i still can't find myself liking him or being interested in him, after all of his escalations and manipulations i think he's just over-the-top. idk idk i might just need to rewatch ch.2 again.</p>
                        <p>also i literally just realized this but like. <span class="spoiler">is monoTV's default-setting voice fucking teruko's voice.</span> dawg......</p>

                        <p>(10-16-24) just read SCP-8980 and it is SUCH an engaging and unnerving dissection of systematic abuse. not even a thirds of the way in and I could TELL where the author probably pulled their inspo from in their real life and it is just awfully realistic and dreadful. the story is packed with such gravity, makes you feel such anger and leaves you endlessly dissatisfied and empty. the amnesiac scene. fucking hell</p>
                        <p>what the complete eradication of self-autonomy and identity does to a mf. i feel a connection to this one like no other.</p>

                        <summary>mouthwashing - videogame</summary>
                        <p>everything's better on the second run. my favorite thing about this game is how complex and layered all of the characters feel, despite the relatively short runtime and the jittery non-linear storytelling, i felt like i'd known them for much longer. all of my feelings boil down to "holy shit i feel awful for everyone involved." except that one guy ofc. i didn't necessarily feel horror or fear, just an overarching feeling of disbelief that keept getting stacked and stacked. very compelling story.</p>

                        <summary>RIBBIT - deltarune mod</summary>
                        <p>i want to write a much longer dissection and analysis of this mod because WOW. it has been so long since i've become THIS fixated on a story before. i wasn't aware that the mod would "get darker" - i just went into it thinking it was a comedy mod and was THRILLED and completely captivated when it began its heel turn. i know some people were turned off by it, but i thought the shift in tone enhanced what came before it and marked an iconic sort of uniqueness away from any other mod. i don't think it was as dark as others have described: there is, i think, fitting amounts of consequence and fitting amounts hope granted to the main 3.</p>
                        <p>i do think that a lot of the worldbuilding could have been condensed. the gift, the mothers, manos, the wishes-- it is so very difficult to understand on 1st playthrough. while it does give replays a lot more value, there is the extra dilemma of the lore documents saying things that are so out of nowhere and destructive to the dark world we thought we knew... that i really fail to understand why they were included. i 100% get there is a bigger picture, and also a hyper-specific vision that the author has. i can try to grasp it as much as i want but i don't think i'll ever be able to get all of it. ig the mystery is the fun of it, but tbh i find more fun and value out of creating my own interpretations rather than trying to decipher existing lore. that's not a completely bad thing btw. </p>
                        <p>bc despite the deeeeeper story being inaccessible imo, the fact that the author still managed to create a world so vibrant and engaging and characters you want to root for no matter what... a world that even if not understandable, i STILL want to engage with on my own terms? that is a VERY GOOD thing. it's rly hard for a complex story to not be boring, and this one certainly isn't. there's a also lot of mixed opinions i have about the ambiguity of control for everyone effected by manos and what it even means. but i wanna save that for another time.</p>
                        <p>TLDR; i love the story and characters, but everything deeper than surface level makes my head spin and i feel like ignoring canon sometimes LOL.</p>

                        <summary>crocodile complex - comic</summary>
                        <p>the story is written in a way where both leads' words and actions are completely understandable and it's just kind of devastating to see anyways. the fact that this is (I THINK) based off of the author's own experience as a former cadet makes the reading of this even more scary and worth dissecting. there is just a looming atmosphere of sinking, of quiet waiting that always leaves you on edge. the very scratchy and texture-filled artwork helps with this immensely, man i fuckn adore the artwork. one of the more interesting comics i've read in a while.</p>

                            much to think about.

                        <summary>parkour civilization - webseries (THIS ONE IS VERY LONG LOL)</summary>
                        <p>okay you could argue with validity that i'm reading far too much into a nonsense minecraft RP, but let it be known that i am an ex-DSMP fan and it will forever be ingrained in my nature. i HAVE to. anyways.</p>
                        <p>i feel so bad for seawatt in season 2, he was the victim of a conflict between his leaders that neither him and his people were ever going to survive. the system that he had trusted left him with nothing and in the end he is the only one burdened with this knowledge because he's the last one to survive. seeing everybody around him worshipping this status quo that he knows is screwed but simultaneously serving it himself nonetheless. living detached in luxury until some naïve bozo comes along and finally has the nerve to change the status quo... and does. but seawatt doesn't see evbo in a light of hope, instead, he sees him as a way to avenge what he'd lost: he can use evbo to finally overthrow this system which has done him so wrong. so he works with evbo while hating him all the way, yet he can't help but admire him because he is so much stronger than he'll ever be. but in the end, seawatt dies. the user becomes the used, and as thanks for freeing him, the parkour villain kills him. nothing had changed- he died as a victim to the problems of champions, the same as the rest of the 5th layer all those years ago. and in the end, evbo will escape and defeat the villain, save parkour civilization... but there is NO mention of the 5th layer in the ending sequence at all - the 5th layer presumably remains hidden and it's unknown if seawatt's people see any justice
                        </p>
                        <p>there is something to be said as well, as to how easily it is for the elites to rewrite history on a whim, and how they are able to shrug it off and live life as normal, while it is only the people below them who suffer. neither the parkour villain or the old man face repercussions for what they've done - they simply get the peace of death. and it's arguable if their crimes are brought to light at all after season 2 ends. the old man obviously regretted sealing off the 5th layer/killing everyone, but it was such a drastic measure to keep just ONE person away. if your control over a populous is so fickle that you have to erase an entire civilization to keep its knowledge under your power, then you were not a good leader to begin with, and you don't deserve your power. perhaps this is why the old man falls into the void after giving evbo the key in the 1st movie, maybe its why he hides the fact he's close to death when evbo becomes champion... he feels so much guilt that he doesn't even want a place in parkour civilization- he knows he doesn't deserve it. yet still, he keeps all of his actions a secret from the NEW champion who HE guided to power until on his deathbed. evbo has to discover it all himself, and in the process, he hurts evbo and the rest of parkour civilization by leaving him clueless and prime to be led into a trap... which seawatt and the parkour villain take advantage of. if the old man hadn't been a coward then maybe the parkour villain wouldn't have even been freed again, maybe even MORE people wouldn't have needed to die.
                        </p>
                        <p>one thing i dont necessarially like abt season 2 is the fact much of the good guys' actions were justified under the guise of "there was no other way" because the parkour villain was simply an even bigger bad that needed to be contained.</p>
                        <p>there is so much commentary that can be said about "never meet your heroes" and never put your full faith in leaders... but the 2nd season doesn't dive much into that kind of commentary. i'm well-aware that it's just a silly minecraft rp, but after all of the capitalism metaphors in season 1, i'd expected season 2 to go into more of that as well. tell me if i am wrong abt the parkour villain thou i could have missed smtn. lore got a lil confusing in that aspect imo</p>
                        <p>it is still a very entertaining movie though and i did enjoy watching it. but imo season 1 is an S-tier and season 2 is a B-tier. PVP civilization is on my watchlist.

                    <p>you ever read a nsfw fanfiction so beautiful that it inspires you to write again?</p>
                    <p>not write smut, i'm talking like regular sfw. anyways, that's happening with me rn. hi, i'm
                        getting back into writing prose again. thank you fandom authors of ao3, i owe this
                        creative-writing rejuvenation to you. i don't even know what re-animator is.</p>
                    <p>on a more serious note, i've been stuck in a bit of a writing slump for around a year or two now
                        and have recently and very suddenly leapt out of it.
                        the journal entry from 5-24-24's just REEEEKS of that old frustration.
                        dunno how long this motivation will last but for the first time
                        in a very long time i'm having fun with writing again. amazing what the palpable
                        love-of-the-game of another creator can do to a mf.
                    </p>
                    <p>i feel like how i was at 15 years old doing her first nanowrimo: <i>that</i> is the speed at
                        which
                        i am pouring my guts out into this google doc. unfortunately, some things never change and i
                        will never post 100% of what i am working on...
                        just know that i'm on that GRIND. the grind for a prequel oneshot for marcene, isra, and
                        callisto, abt how they all met and died and revived and allthat. i'll likely
                        put out some related artwork instead when i'm finished. yippe!</p>
