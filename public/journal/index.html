                        <p>aghhh. the lil upload schedule experiment for jan-apr is over and i think i'll be on indefinite(?) hiatus now. urkkkk. all things considered, the site is as finished as it can be, with one years' (wowie) worth of artwork archived and all pages completed. it's been real & fun as hell o7 idk when i'll b updating again if at all, so i felt compelled to put a notice here in case i don't.</p>
                        <p>i'll b honest lol, whenever i need an ego boost i just open the site in my files and browse thru the monthly pages. i noticed i tend to favor a semi-specific aesthetic and palette every few months and it's rly interesting to browse thru for me. i didnt even rly intend for each set of updates to be "color-coded" - it's so fun to see how each style compares and evloves from each other.</p>
                        <p>dunno, it feels like the site has completed its purpose for now, ykwim. like i set out to archive my artwork as i make it, and here we are, a years' worth of material for viewing ^-^</p>
                        <p>i also updated the look of my site while i was at it. nothing was wrong with the old one, i just felt it needed a change.</p>

                            creative writing and being percieved</h3>
                        <p>yknow, publicizing any form of writing, fiction or not, requires a certain amount of trust
                            with or
                            at least some kind of awareness of the audience right. once you make a writing public,
                            it's no longer YOURS - it's the people's. you can intend a certain messege however you want,
                            but what the <i>audience</i> interprets of that message is how YOUR writing will be
                            percieved - not what YOU interpret of it. and that's a hurtle that i have not been able to
                            get over for a majority of my creative journey.</p>

                        <p>...which is kinda paradoxical to say, because i love <i>visual</i> artwork and i love
                            sharing it, so i should be able to share my writing too right? but there is just something different in my mind between the medium of visual
                            art, and the medium of prose, and that difference is strong enough to me that i'm completely
                            turned off by the idea of sharing any of my creative writing to the public & having it be 
                            percieved. i can't explain it, but i don't think i could ever showcase my stories/universes 
                            in a way that feels <i>true</i>.
                            it used to tear me up inside, not being able to get tf over myself (lol) and just post
                            <i>something.</i> but nowadays i've
                            found contentment with fact that the deeper aspects of my work are only available to
                            like the TINIEST select friend group. cuz why do i even NEED to share ALL of my words, you
                            know??!?!? if something's really important to me, why should i ever post
                            it online.</p>

                        <p>i want to redo/repaint over <a href="../artblog/2023/aug-sept/light.html">this</a>
                            artwork eventually.</p>
                        <p>i took a peek at some WIP versions of this i had stowed away, and honestly. i think the
                            final piece is over-rendered.
                            in my illusts, i feel like there's more charm when i leave some parts messy,
                            and tbh i think some messiness would help to add more distinction between the two
                            figures here too. bc i do feel like they blend in too much here.</p>
                        <p id="dead">like, tell me this <a href="images/light-wip.PNG">wip version</a> doesnt have
                            more charm in a way.</p>

                        <h3><span class="highlight-2">&thinsp;2-15-24&thinsp;</span> | dead times</h3>
                        <p>decided to revist an old OC playlist i hadn't listened to in a hot minute and 'spare
                            hearts' from catghost ost switched on and i nearly jumped out of my seat</p>
                        <p>i suddenly remembered how much this story used to influence my own OCs and how i can't
                            stand it now because of an unrelated event that happened around that time. i can say
                            that for so many other medias too, it's unreal that up until now, i've never quite
                            comprehended
                            just how pieces of media that i haven't watched or thought of in years that still show
                            their faces in the things i make to this day. how PTC's power/weapon system still has
                            vague correlations to a glitchtale AU [ew] i made when i was 14, how 'law of talos' was
                            the direct inspiration for callisto and marcene but i can't even stand to watch either
                            of them anymore, among others because of [unrelated].</p>
                        <p>reminded bitterly that many of my stories are created on the backs of inspos that were
                            accumulated over multiple years from all corners of my life and no matter what, i will
                            never not be able see myself through my works, no matter how mundane they are or how
                            much i do not want to be reminded of certain aspects from dead times.</p>
                        it feels very silly to say all of this about pieces of writing that i'll probably never
                        publicize at all, but regardless of that, death of the author feels reaaally far away from
                        me.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <!-- <h3 id="status"><span class="highlight-2">&thinsp;2-6-24&thinsp;</span> | site status</h3>
                        <p>i think that this site is nearing a 'complete' state, like with my more recent artworks,
                            i feel less of an urge to post/archive them here on neocities. with how selective i feel
                            about art-posting going into 2024, i feel like i've grown beyond this site, and i'm no
                            longer compelled to use it in the way that i've been using it like in 2023. after i
                            finish uploading jan-feb(?)'s batch of artwork, this site will probably go through a
                            revamp- i don't have any specific plans, i just think i need to do something
                            *different.* all artwork will stay up, of course, tho the exterior and main 'purpose'
                            will probs change a tad.</p>

                            feeling?
                        </h3>
                        <p>I DONT KNOW!! i dont know how i feel abt this one tbh. my main intent going into this was
                            to
                            tidy up file paths, but to more importantly, clean up the mobile version of the site.
                            something that REALLLY bugged me abt the old layout was the fact that, since all of the
                            main
                            content was inside of a scrollable div instead of the &lsaquo;main&rsaquo; tag, the
                            search
                            bar in mobile browsers wouldn't HIDE when you scrolled down the page. and considering
                            x & y overflow were hidden too, this caused a lotta visual disparity for the main
                            content
                            block depending on the phone screen's size. this new layout was my attempt to fix that.
                        </p>
                        <p>i'll have to journal out how it looks on more devices to be 100% sure, but im v sure this
                            issue
                            has been solved now. a part of me really misses the smaller, more compact look though.
                            it's
                            not all that different actually, but the old one was specifically more... rounder imo.
                            i'll
                            probably tweak the layout some more later down the line to get that vibe back, but we'll
                            see.

                        </h3>
                        <p>i was rereading some older OC profiles, and i realized that...
                            the more i like a character of mine, the more pathetically i describe them
                            &#128557; ...and it's not in the endearing "aww poor thing &#60;/3" kinda
                            pathetic, i mean, descriptions that are so deprecating they legitimatly give you
                            second-hand emberassment.
                        </p>
                        <p>i think i do this out of a subconscious fear of not giving my faves enough flaws. like.
                            fear
                            of them being percieved as a mary sue or "creator's pet" .....but in my desire to hold
                            back
                            my favoritism, i just end up writing them so unfavorably instead</p>
                        <p>hmm, its so tough when u have a fave. no matter how hard u try, u can't portray them how
                            u
                            do in ur head. its either pretentious writing or severe nerfing in my experience. when i
                            read older writings of mine, the aspects i deemed as my least favorites ended up being
                            the most well-written in the end, because i didn't take them too seriously.
                        </p>
                        <p>its so hard not to take a character seriously tho when u already care so much.
                            how tf do ppl do it.... how to disconnect, my whole heart is in this bitch !!!
