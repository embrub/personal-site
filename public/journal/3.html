                            </h3>
                            <p>i mentioned in a <a href="#af-theme">previous entry</a> that i wanted to gamble a lil and
                                join team werewolf, but i ended up picking vampire in the end. i slightly regretted it
                                when the event actually started and i realized literally 70% of my bookmarks are
                                on my team,,, so i'd just invertedly signed myself up for ONLY doing friendly-fires thru
                                the month NAURR ;o;
                            </p>
                            <p>i was so close to switching teams but then i settled down when i realized
                                team vamp was actually losing and i was a part of the underdogs now. instant team
                                loyalty.
                                still kinda pissed abt the friendly-fires thing tho. i've been thoroughly nerfed.</p>
                            <p>anyways heres <a href="https://artfight.net/~embr_s_">my profile</a> or whatever.

                            <p>idk why, but it's so much easier for me to fall into burnout now guhhh. i got projects i
                                still wanna work on, but starting em seems like more of a chore now ;o;
                            </p>
                            <p>this site being kinda a huge example, like i wanna make some shrines and maybe another
                                page to showcase some OC playlists. a lotta work thou....... think i just need to find 
                                more medias to become obsesed with again

                                2023 themes</h3>
                            <p>oh wow o WOW this year's theme reveal came as such a suprise to me</p>
                            <p>with such powerhouses of potential prompts like "order vs chaos" and "creation vs
                                destruction" i did not expect that "vampires vs werewolves" would be the final pick. ngl
                                out
                                of all of em tho, vamps vs werewolves has the most mascot potential n also aligns pretty
                                well with previous themes... so i see why it was chosen but like.... personally i was
                                rooting for "time vs space" myself &lt;--- she is full of OC-themed biases
                            </p>
                            <p>team picks this year are gonna be HARD though... previously my personal preferences
                                would align exactly with one side, but this year i am SO very unsure. "vampire" is
                                calling
                                to me but i have a feeling numbers are gonna be incredibly skewed this year. EVERYONE's
                                gonna pick team vampire mannnnn, "wither vs bloom" last year was so engaging imo cuz
                                the numbers were so close but i have a feeling my werewolf folks might be the
                                underdogs.......... which makes my gambling instincts tingle.

                            <p>ok so i made a new layout for the site? i really dunno how i feel about this one guhh.
                                old
                                layout had this minimalist, metalic-like color scheme
                                and while i didn't like it much at first, i'd gotten used to it by the time i whipped
                                up this new softer, notebook-like look ;o;</p>

                            <p>old style:</p>
                            <a href="images/screenshot.png">

                            <p>the new vers def has its charm & def more cohesion,,,,, but im going thru some kinda
                                stockholm syndrome rn lol. i wanna try and incorporate the darker gray colors into this
                                new theme's colors somehow, i tried it a lil but i just. could not. get it to look 
                                right. rip.
                            </p>
                            <p>oh well i guess that comes with running a website- constant changes & updates & fusses, i
                                know i'll probs never be satisfied eheh. this new theme needs some work tho too-- i see
                                so
                                many mfs on neocities with the most cluttered and colorful websites with blinkers and
                                weird
                                shiny things that i dont even know how they put in there. & that's soso inspiring,,, i
                                wanna
                                clutter my site too but i gotta PLAN for it bc ik i'll probablay most likely trip over
                                myself
                                if not lol. mostly i wanna add more oranges and reds and browns guhhh.

                            <p>there is no album that breaks me more than void fantasy by ada rook,</p>
                            <p>some of the phrases and gutteral instrumentals in these are so emotionally relatable to
                                me
                                even though im not sure where it all comes from. reaching "dream of escape" is like a
                                punch to the gut man. although i def like ada's newer works more, this one just hits a 
                                little different ykwim.
