            <h4>character featured: callisto</h4>
            <p>just realized tht i made his head abit too big and its too late to change it rip ig.
            <p>ok so, this is a redesign of his old mead hall fit. once again, AM continues to be historically 
                innacurate to its inspirations. what even time period is this meant to be. whocares  
                uhh i added a cool viel !
            </p>
            <p>hmmm i don't know what compelled me to wanna change the old version, but i do think that 
                lore-wise it makes more sense for him to be covering his face while outside the ring. 
                also the hat ties the outfit nicely together as well, i always felt like smthn was missing,, 
            </p>
            <p>heres the old version for comparison:</p>
            <a href="images/oldvers.png"><img src="images/oldvers.png" class="vert" alt="orange-haired man in a dress-shirt and suspenders. this drawing is significantly messier than the last"></a>
            <p>what the fuck are those shoes though</p>
