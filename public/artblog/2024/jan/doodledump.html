        <p>you know who it is. </p>
        <a href="images/zo-lol.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-lol.jpeg" alt="two doodles, to the left is enzo without his signature 'halo ahoge,' captioned, 'who?' - to the right is enzo with the ahoge, captioned 'oh, it's enzo.'"></a>
        <p>i drew these at various points in between winter break's end and spring break's beginning. 
            the first drawing was a doodle from my class notes that i colored digitally, and the one below i
            drew immediatley after finishing my last final. fitting visual.</p>
        <a href="images/zo-snooze.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-snooze.jpeg" alt="scratchy and sketchy digital artwork of enzo asleep at a desk. "></a>

        <a href="images/zo-sketch.jpeg"><img src="images/zo-sketch.jpeg" alt="digital artwork of enzo staring sharply at the camera. he's shrouded in darkness, except for a dull spotlight shining on him from overhead. the backdrop is an eyestraining cyan."></a>

        <p>overall i don't have much to say about these. they were stress relievers in between schoolwork and so are rly
            sloppy and not too visually *there.* heres one of trinity.
        </p>
        <a href="images/trinityy.jpeg"><img src="images/trinityy.jpeg" alt="a pastel-colored digital illustration of trinity looking tentatively to the side. the lineart is scratchy and free-form, and the colors spill from the lines, making the art look inky, blotchy, and hazy."></a>

        <br>
        <p>anyhow, i've drawn a bit more than this but i refrain from sharing them for now. most of them are reference sheets for
            projects new and old, and so it feels odd to dump all of them in a post uncategorized. thinking of making an
            actual page to briefly showcase all my ocs and their refs. someday soon.</p>
        <p>gahhh these past few months in particular have been p slow for polished artworks, i feel kinda sad abt it,, 
            the consistency in which motivation hits will continue to be scattered ig. mostly, i feel insane.
