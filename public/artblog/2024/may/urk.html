        <p>urk this is kinda a freeform sketchbook spread to get my mind off work. it's doodles of archer but you can hardly tell lol</p>
        <p>out of all the polished drawings i could have sent, i gave this one to my school's illustration club LMAOOO. it was for a little prompt event idk. i was listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/i-r1yhDQRFs?si=gob0zWCrndrSq5wV" target="_blank">this song</a> as i drew. weep, for no one can possibly comprehend my sophisticated and curated music taste.</p>
        <p>also fyi, that's a sticker i found under a lunch table, i could never join a sorority, eep.</p>
        <br>
        <p>ohyeah, bonus doodle that i didnt know where else to put:</p>
        <a href="images/warcriminal.png"><img src="images/warcriminal.png" loading="lazy" alt="lyre clutching her head whilst wearing a wide perturbed smile. she yells, 'I *NEED* THAT WAR CRIMINAL!!!' behind her from a distance, a chibi-styled archer sits unaware."></a>
