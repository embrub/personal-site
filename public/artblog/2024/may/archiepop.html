        <p>it is what the title sayssss. these two were quick doodles, not much to say about em, i just think theyre cute.</p>
        <p>day by day it feels like i have less time to draw, so the lasso tool became a v quick way to speed up my art proccess. i've been using it a lot this month and been digging the crisp, sharp look that it can produce. kinda gives a paper collage feel, if you know what i mean.</p>
