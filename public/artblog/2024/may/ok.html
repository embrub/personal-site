            <p>ive gaslit myself into thinking i liked the cold for the whooole year, but then summer hits and my mood
            immediatly becomes way better than it's ever been, funny how that works.
            opening my blinds and the sun is up early and the world is beautiful and i'm warm and maybe the thermostat is
            an illusion but i'd rather be sweating it out than huddled under my blankets in a dreary-ass freezing
            room. im a summer girlie at heart, urkkk so dramatic. here is a celebratory strange drawing of enzo for 
            the occasion. ok. don't think aboyt it</p>
