                    <summary>a self-reflection on this era of my artwork [& the fear of regression]</summary>
                    <p>i used to feel a lot of shame over these artworks, so much so that i almost decided not to share them here.
                        not because they're bad, but because of the complete opposite- the fact that i believe these
                        arts are way more technically sound and visually appealling than what i make in 2023-24.</p>
                    <p>i think that the fear of 'getting worse' is one that's prevalent among artists, and i especially
                        had internalized this a lot in early 2023. when i started diverging from my usual art program 
                        from 21-22. during this time i was noticing stagnation in my 'improvement,' and i felt such panic over it,, but now looking back, 
                        i think that's dramatic to say. (1)well duh i'm rusty, i'm using a newer program. (2)it's 
                        like. really fun to experiment. staying in the same style/techniques/program forever sounds kinda 
                        boring anyhow.</p>
                    <p>hiding this era's drawings seems like a shame cuz they're genuinely really good. but
                        letting them define my art now also seems like a shame too. so. we have the equilibrium.
                        acceptance~~</p>
                    <p>i feel a lot less shame looking at my 21-22 works today. my newer stuff's different, sure, but calling
                        one era of work 'better' than another is just a bit unfair imo. simplier or more mundane doesn't
                        equate to being worse, and for what i make now, my art fits.</p>
                    <p>mostly, i just want to draw my hot fish boys in peace.</p>

                <p>i mourn my younger self whose very first social media experience was fucking amino. but all things
                    considered, the very last community i was involved in was best place i could have been posting in
                    before i left. the art i made on the 'just shapes and beats' [or jsab] fandom was so fruitful,
                    and later sowed the seeds for the story projects i have today, PTC among one of them.</p>
                <p><strong>so, here is a <a href="http://aminoapps.com/p/shhfku" target="_blank">compilation</a> of my
                        old 2019 illusts for the JSAB fandom.</strong>
                    now u have context to the allusive 'APU' i mention here sometimes lol. 
                    even though they're mildly emberassing to me, all things considered, i
                    think a lotta this old stuff still has charm. they're illusts i'm relatively proud to share here.</p> -->
                <!-- <details>
                    <summary>and now: a misc rant on the absolute state of amino, because despite my last experience
                        being a good
                        one, it is far far farrr from a good place, and i need to get some repressed shit off my chest.
                    </summary>
                    <hr class="small">
                    <p>it is so incredibly sad how there are so little designated social hangout spaces for kids online.
                        that these young people gotta gather on social platforms that are so incredibly unsuitable for
                        them. amino is a place that i found out about in 2016 when i was 13, via paid promotions from
                        *multiple*
                        animation-meme YT channels. so based on that alone, the app's marketing was obviously targeted
                        towards young people aswell, yeah?</p>
                    <p>so tell me why amino's moderation system was so janky and free-for-all;
                        why not a single community i was a part of was free from shit moderators and infighting.
                        why every single testimony from mutuals who also used the app, could name encounters with
                        pedos, creeps, or other frequent harrassment from degens. tell me why years later, amino would
                        partner with KIK, a 17+ platform. and how when i checked in after years of inactivity, i was met
                        with camgirls and suggestive live videos on the front page, for a platform
                        initially advertised for a younger audience. fucks sake.</p>
                    <p>amino in general was such a wild-west of a social platform. kids leading
                        and making rules for other kids [in communities with usually <i>thousands</i> of members], and
                        the few
                        official staff i met being generally unhelpful, how the average userbase could not
                        have been any older than 12... i was lucky that the aminos i was prominent on [Danplan, JSAB,
                        SMP****] had more teenaged demographics, and so i was able to be around people my age. but
                        still, the majority of other aminos that i dedicated my time to, i remember making me
                        miserable. and there are sooo many other testimonies that could vouch. did ANYONE have a good
                        experience in this place?
