                            <p>Living doll, historian, academic. Giomi is obsessively deciphering a series of runes that are supposedly responsible for reviving the dead.</p>
                            <p>Always chipper and happy to teach, she will gladly geek out about her dead-end findings for eons. Her dedication did not stem from <i>any</i> desire to save the dead, however. But rather, from the fact she is missing all of her memories prior to her discovery of these runes.</p> 
                            <p>A shady past, an eccentric passion, and a cutthroat desire for knowledge. Despite her admirable profession, most tend to stay clear of her.</p>

                            <p>With a gaping wound through his chest, hollow eyes as black as the sky, and a body with no heart - inexplicably he's still alive - and he's here for a reason. His existence, he deemed, is proof that the universe has allowed him to resume his duty.</p>
                            <p>The war is over, but his job isn't, not until every other surviving enemy has been wiped off the galaxy.</p>

                            <h3>keyata</h3>
                            <p>Keyata is a painting prodigy who can draw any subject just from muscle memory, who now tries her best to to reconnect with her passions after the recent loss of her eyesight.</p>
                            <p>Naturally very shy and soft-spoken, it takes a while to formulate her thoughts and she habitually pauses in between her sentences. She's the type to choose her words carefully. Too timid to break rules, but too much of a thinker to stay still, Keyata wants a lot out of life and believes she was meant for greater things.</p>

                            <h3>ali</h3>
                            <p>Prototype for a new line of robots. He was considered a failure and nearly scrapped, but was instead repurposed into a caretaker bot.
                                The distressing experience led him to develop sentience.</p>
                            <p>He has a calm and relaxed, yet stern attitude. Has little patience and will not hesitate to throw the occasional shade your way. Carries with him an air of grandiosity, although it's obviously a bit to cover up how much distaste he has for his caretaker role. Believes he was meant for greater things.</p>

                            <p>Emerson was involved in and helped oversee the creation of WME's newest line of robots.</p>
                            <p>After the project was discontinued, Emerson has considered the one remaining sentient prototype her greatest accomplishment and has a... very obsessive fascination with it. The kind of fascination which warrants dissecting it limb from limb to figure out what makes it tick.</p>

                            <p>The man whose image Ali was built around. Though he's dead, his influence still lingers.</p>
