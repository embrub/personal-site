                        <p>Always chipper and happy to teach, she will gladly geek out about her dead-end findings for
                            eons. Her dedication did not stem from <i>any</i> desire to save the dead, however. But
                            rather, from the fact she is missing all of her memories prior to her discovery of these
                            runes.</p>
                        <p>A shady past, an eccentric passion, and a cutthroat desire for knowledge. Despite her

                            Last-minute, he was instead repurposed into a common caretaker bot.
                            The distressing experience led him to develop sentience.</p>
                        <p>He has a relaxed, yet stern attitude, and is unafraid to throw the occasional shade. Carries
                            with him an air of grandiosity, though it's obviously a bit to cover up his distaste for the
                            caretaker role. Believes he was meant for greater things.</p>

                    possible since i will likely never publicize the projects these charries are from :D maybe i will
                    share more someday but for now,, secrets secrets secretssss~~ i've put just enough to understand my
                    arts a little better as an outsider, so i hope it was a neat read nonetheless.</p>
