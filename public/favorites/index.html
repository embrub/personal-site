                    good songs. music is what inspires a good chunk of my creative proccess nowadays and these

                    most relevant to me atm.

                            <p>i found this album through the "skid vs larry" fight and ended up liking it a lot.
                                like, became my #1, <i>a lot</i>. "sweet melodies & edgy instrumentals," huh? what a
                                vibe. 90% of my OC inspo comes from here and looking at the lyrics i think it's v

                            <p>any track of rook&nomie's is phenomenal. the two of them piece together stories about
                                home and companionship through music like a mystical sci-fi. just otherworldly
                                sound.
                                if you listen to any album on here, it should be this one.</p>

                        consume, you bet i will be looping the same 10 or so songs till i die. black dresses and GHOST 
                        are two very relevent artists in this tope of mine. i tried my best to diversify this selection 
                        of songs though, encompany as much of my "taste" as possible in 6 songs, as confused it may be to me.

                    winter time. also shoutout to "ghosst(s)" which was the backbone to all of PTC's worldbuilding
                    ideas, i'd slap the OST to "lethargy hill" in here too if i could.

                <p>a bit of a vague category, yeah? this is a showcase for medias whose narratives have greatly
                    effected me and the kinda stuff i wanna create. i say "medias" cos i don't wanna limit what
                    i decide to put in this section, even tho there's only 4 of them here right now, haha. anyways.
                    it's mostly horror stories [or horror-adjacent] that tend to stick with me, and it is horror that i will share :}

                <p>kitty horrorshow's writing is a joy, her descriptions are so vivid and gross and intruiging. i
                    watched thru "lethargy hill" on youtube before i played the <a
                        href="https://kittyhorrorshow.itch.io/haunted-cities-v4" target="_blank">games</a>
                    that it was a part of. despite it being the least mechanically interesting and the most
                    simplistic story out of all of them, this one utterly captivated me.</p>
                <p>"there should be more here," huh. it's a story about a tormented and
                    disolusioned creator, and i guess its dreariness is something that drew me in. this might
                    just be me speaking out of my ass here, but this feels so second-hand - i KNOW this house
                    and it's so..... uncomfortable? idk if that makes sense, i hope u see my vision tho. &#128564;

                <p>this animation lives in my head rent free. three years and still, i can't get over the feelings
                    that overcame me when i first watched it, never can tire of it. it's the type of horror that isn't
                    scary per se, just sad and dreadful.</p>
                <p>this was the first vivinos animation i watched, and since then, they've only
                    created far more impressive works. if this seems like your cup of tea, i highly reccomend

                <p>WHOAHHH. just wow, you know? these 3 games are up there for one of my favorite game series of
                    all time. FAITH is the story of a priest returning to a home in which he failed 
                    an exorcism years ago, and attempts to finish the job... (image links to steam page)

                            the story to me, while it is a horror around the 80s satanic panic first, it is
                            an exploration about the battle with guilt, trauma, and your own faith

                        starts as a series of dumb shitposts and then evolves into. horror.
                        i’ve reread it who knows how many times, couldn’t recommend more. [<a

                        as it goes on, tackling themes of destiny, agency, survivor's guilt... a masterfully paced

                        necromancers "taking care of" a family’s web of lies. Gorgeous artwork and eye-catching page
                        layouts, with such a fascinating story that I can’t seem to wrap my head around but am enamored
                        by all the same. [<a

                    <li><span class="highlight-2">Lovebot</span> &ndash; A cute and tender, yet somewhat existential and
                        frankly really angsty sci-fi love story with themes of identity and purpose, told through the
                        eyes of a robot designed for sex. LBGBT-centric! [<a

                        story. It's a toxic relationship set in space, revolving around a dude and the
                        robot who looks an awful lot like the asshole who got him fired.

                        kids trying to make it through the world and keep the supernatural horrors at bay. told through
                        the eyes of a 15-year-old religious recluse, tobias schneien. while the opening quarter of the
                        comic’s dialogue is rather ametur, the character writing evolves into <strong>the best I have
                            ever read</strong>, especially from a comic which uneshamedlessly portrays messy aspects of 
                            mental anguish. such complex and gray characters i love to observe. [<a

                        When the nature of humanity is so fluctuating and complex? This is what Scarlet, the newest grim
                        reaper, is forced to grapple with when assigned her new job-- to kill one sinner a day.
                        Unashamdlessly edgy, I adore it and what it stands for. [<a

                        Home, Flawed Almighty is about the relationship between a sinner cursed by God, and his
                        guardian angel. It's a somewhat stark shift from kim's original horror works, now taking a focus on…
                        comedy. Which he nails. Both MCs are so endearing and easy to root for, and jeonji’s
                        arc, like all of kim's MCs, never fails to feel so uniquely human. [<a
