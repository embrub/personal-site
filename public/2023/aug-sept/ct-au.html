            <p>eheh. so i had this modern-day/normal AU crossover thingy with all of my story
                projects from like a year back, and i decided to revisit it with PTC. i think giomi would
                be a grade school history teacher in this AU, and amias is one of her students :D
            </p>
            <p>i need to think abt it a lil more tho. i wanna give this lil alternate universe an actual story
                but all of my ideas r discombobulated scenes tht i need to figure out how to stitch
                together,, some real pantser shit.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>here's a ref for enzo's design too which i am significantly less happy with, ehe.</p>

                <a href="images/enzo-ctau-ref.png"><img src="images/enzo-ctau-ref.png" class="vert" alt="reference sheets for enzo, he's wearing semi-formal modern clothes in one, and a heavy black coat in the other."></a>
            <p>i wanted to do a little DR:SE callback with the gray-ish suit but i think his design is just
                way too boring here ;o; same w the everyday one. the black cape jacket fits him but i need to figure
                out smthn to make it more interesting. i'll redo it eventually.</p>

            <p><strong>EDIT NOV 11</strong>: adjusted it a lil, think its much better this way.</p>
            <a href="images/enzo-ctau-ref2.png"><img src="images/enzo-ctau-ref2.png" alt="same as previous image, except with minor adjustments (shirt length, a scarf to go with his jacket, etc.)"></a>
            <p>also, unlike gio, im not 100% sure where he'd work at. some generic businessy-office-y thing
                probably. he also has like a. vaguely shady military background, of course. wouldn't be
                enzo without one.
            </p>
            <p>anyways,</p>

            <p>otis's character in this au doesn't belong to me, so im not sure if im gonna make a ref sheet
                for him. there he is thou!
