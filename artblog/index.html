                <h1>&loz;2019</h1>
                <p>i mourn my younger self whose very first social media experience was fucking amino. but all things
                    considered,
                    the very last community i was involved in was best place i could have been posting in before i left.
                    the art i
                    made on the 'just shapes and beats' [or jsab] fandom was so fruitful, and later sowed the seeds for
                    the story projects
                    i have today, PTC among one.</p>
                <p><strong>so, here is a <a href="http://aminoapps.com/p/shhfku" target="_blank">compilation</a> of my
                        old 2019 illusts for the JSAB fandom.</strong>
                    now u have context to the allusive 'APU' i mention here sometimes lol. all things considered, i
                    think a lotta these still have charm and are illusts i'm relatively proud to share here.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>and now: a misc rant on the absolute state of amino, because despite my last experience being a good
                        one, it is far far farrr from a good place, and i need to get some repressed shit off my chest.</summary>
                    <hr class="small">
                    <p>it is so incredibly sad how there are so little designated social hangout spaces for kids online.
                        that these young people gotta gather on social platforms that are so incredibly unsuitable for
                        them. amino is a place that i found out about when i was 13, via paid promotions from *multiple* 
                        animation-meme YT channels. so based on that alone, the app's marketing was obviously targeted 
                        towards young people aswell, yeah?</p>
                    <p>so tell me why amino's moderation system was so janky and free-for-all;
                        why not a single community i was a part of was free from shit moderators and infighting.
                        why every single testimony from mutuals who also used the app, could name encounters with
                        pedos, creeps, or other frequent harrassment from degens. tell me why years later, amino would 
                        partner with KIK, a 17+ platform. and how when i checked in after years of inactivity, i was met 
                        with camgirls and suggestive live videos on the <strong>front page</strong>, for a platform
                        initially advertised for a younger audience. fucks sake.</p>
                    <p>amino in general was such a wild-west of a social platform. kids leading
                        and making rules for other kids [in communities with usually <i>thousands</i> of members], and the few 
                        official staff i met being generally unhelpful, how the average userbase could not
                        have been any older than 12... i was lucky that the aminos i was prominent on [Danplan, JSAB,
                        SMP****] had more teenaged demographics, and so i was able to be around people my age. but
                        still, the majority of other aminos that i dedicated my time to, i remember making me 
                        miserable. and there are sooo many other testimonies that could vouch. did ANYONE have a good 
                        experience in this place? 
                    </p>
