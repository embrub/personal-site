            <p>whoah more experimental stuff !</p>

            <p>here, i was tryinta tinker n see what style of shading i liked best for
                lineless art (except for the headshot on the top left, which is infact not lineless).
                ouuuuuhhhh not gonna lie, all 3 of these mini illusts have such different vibes, i dunno which one i
                like best. i loved the proccess of drawing the bottom left portrait of enzo, though i feel like what i
                really need for all of these is some experimentation with opacity.</p>
            <p>man i miss my slightly transparent marker brush from mspaint i miss her so much.</p>
            <p>anyways,</p>
            <h3>me anytime i talk about these two characters:</h3>

            <p>can you guess which is the evil and which is the baby boy</p>
            <p>ohyeah some closing words: <strong>none of these doodles are canon !</strong> :thumbs up: especially 
                archer's living design. not that it matters that much.
